  name: ZHA - Philips Hue Dimmer Switch (Fixed)
  description: 'Control lights with a Philips Hue Dimmer Switch.

    The top "on" button will turn the lights on to the last set brightness

    (unless the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint).

    Dim up/down buttons will change the brightness smoothly and can be pressed

    and hold until the brightness is satisfactory.


    The bottom "off" button will turn the lights off.
